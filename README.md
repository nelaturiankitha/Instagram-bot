# Instagram bot using selenium
This code logs into Instagram, searches for the "mealprep" tag, and extracts the number of likes and comments from posts. It then creates a line plot to visualize the likes and comments for each post. Please note that Instagram's structure may change, and this code is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. You may need to adapt the CSS selectors and logic to match the current Instagram structure and requirements. Additionally, always comply with Instagram's terms of service when scraping data.
